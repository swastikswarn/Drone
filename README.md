## 🚀 Drone Overview

In this project, we are building a **basic quadcopter (X-configuration)** using:

- A2212 BLDC motors  
- 30A ESCs  
- Q450 frame  
- **KK2.1.5 Flight Controller**
- FlySky CT6B transmitter & receiver system  

This drone is designed for **learning, experimentation, and understanding multirotor flight control** using a **standalone flight controller**.

The next parts will include **wiring, KK2.1.5 setup, calibration, and test flights**.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Always follow **Li-Po battery safety precautions**
- Ensure correct **motor direction and propeller orientation**
- Secure ESCs and wiring properly using cable ties
- Remove propellers during configuration and calibration
